<p>Most certainly, without a severe uptick in rates, we shouldnâ€™t see much of a severeÂ CREÂ value issue.
With cap rates rising slightly in 2020, the marginal delta of theÂ increase will most likely be absorbed by the rent rate increases.</p>

<p>We expect anchored retail to remain strongÂ despiteÂ online shopping as local space keeps beingÂ absorbed by service tenants, restaurants, insurance store fronts,Â CBDÂ oil locations, etc.</p>

<p>Sunshine states will continue growth as taxes remain low or zero.</p>

<p>Northeast and Midwest rust belt states will continue to lose population as service jobs income tries but fails to replaceÂ manufacturingÂ and high-tech jobs.</p>

<p>Lenders will continue to not only watch their â€œbucketsâ€ for property type but be more mindful of hotels and other food groups that can be affected by an economic downturn. Lenders will continue to and rightly so, demand that documentation be aligned with S&amp;U and projected operating costs presented by borrowers. We expect the refinance market to be brisk as a plethora of construction projects hit stabilization after some seasoning that is market and project driven.</p>

<p>Borrowers will have to be more creative in their approach to development as equity requirements are not expected to narrow. We are expecting those who qualify by experience, track record and reporting prowess to continue to be top clients of Crowd Funding firms.</p>

<p>Even many experienced top tier developers are finding a niche for â€œfill inâ€ equity via Crowd Funding.
Griffin consults in the Crowd Funding arena and has had success with projects using Crowd Funding. This arena is a much more efficient means than friends and family and or country club equity.</p>
