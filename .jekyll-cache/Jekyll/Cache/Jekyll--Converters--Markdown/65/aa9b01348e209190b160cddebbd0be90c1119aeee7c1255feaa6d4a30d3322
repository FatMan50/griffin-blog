I"∞<p>Acquiring a loan for your commercial real estate project can be a complicated process. Even the veteran developers with decades in the industry can sometimes struggle navigating the market.

<p>Don‚Äôt agonize over the borrowing process. The Griffin Group team is here to make each transaction seamless, and straightforward. We will shed light on even the most confusing aspects of the commercial lending process. Let‚Äôs start with some of the commonly misunderstood concepts you may encounter at the initiation of a loan request.</p>

<h2 id="1-equity-options-for-the-capital-stack">1. Equity options for the capital stack</h2>

<p>The distinction between debt and equity is clear enough, but what about the different types of equity? There are multiple instruments of equity, the most popular of which include Straight, Preferred and Joint Venture.</p>

<p>Straight Equity is generally used by start-ups or new businesses. This equity type offers shared ownership of that business to its investors in exchange for C corporation stock, limited liability company (LLC) membership units.</p>

<p>Preferred Equity is similar, but generally entitles investors to force sale of property in the event that the investment performs poorly. Another difference with Preferred Equity (Pref) is the ‚Äúequity kicker‚Äù which is an additional benefit to investors should the investment perform well. One of the features that makes Pref so popular with borrowers, is the potential of gaining higher leverage at a lower cost. Investors receive the opportunity for a fixed rate return with priority of payment and some upside.</p>

<p>Joint Venture (JV) Equity is the riskiest option, but offers the highest upside. There are two companies forging the agreement: one is the capital partner providing the equity, and the other is the operating member, who manages the project.The losses and profits are shared by all partners. A key difference between JV and Pref is that there‚Äôs no priority of payment on proceeds. Any profit from a capital event or cash flow distribution is paid pari passu, or ‚Äúequal footing‚Äù, depending on the investment percentages in the agreement.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-term-sheet-is-an-outline-not-a-commitment-letter">2. The ‚ÄúTerm Sheet‚Äù is an outline, not a commitment letter</h2>

<p>One of the biggest frustrations a borrow may experience, is receiving a final offer that looks different from the initial term sheet. To alleviate this frustration or feeling of being ‚Äòre-traded‚Äù is to understand the purpose of this document and its function.</p>

<p>A Term Sheet is a very important document that outlines the terms and conditions which the lender is willing to provide. This document is drafted after a lender has fully vetted the potential borrower to insure the deal could move forward to a full underwrite. However, Term Sheets are not a commitment letter from the lender, and they are not binding. Usually, further documentation is requested in the Term Sheet, so the underwriters can do a full analysis on the borrower.</p>

<p>It is during this analysis of documents like CPA prepared financial statements, Appraisals, Environmental Reports, etc., that new discoveries are made which may alter the original offer from the lender. Once all parties agree to any revisions, that is when a formal commitment letter is issued and all terms are set.</p>

<h2 id="3-skin-in-the-game">3. Skin in the game</h2>

<p>The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) developed a booklet for Commercial Real Estate lending parameters for lenders and borrowers to use as an industry standard. In this handbook, the OCC recommends that lenders establish hard equity guidelines, and conduct an analysis of the borrower‚Äôs equity to be documented in the credit file. It is recommended that a borrower‚Äôs equity contributions should be significant.</p>

<p>The reason why equity is so important, is because it ensures that a borrower has stake in the project. It is in the best interest of the lender to ensure the borrower continues to have economic interest in the project‚Äôs success. It also acts as a cushion for any cost overruns or leashing or sale shortfalls. The OCC handbook also sets the expectation that lenders have clear policies informing borrowers of their ‚Äúequity requirements, types of equity sources, and timing of those contributions‚Äù.</p>

<p>The greatest misconception about this part of the lending process, is which types of equity and equity sources are considered acceptable. It can be confusing because an equity type that is considered acceptable to one lender might be considered Debt to another. PACE BONDS, GRANTS, HISTORIC TAX CREDITS, Tifs, FACADE EASEMENT GRANTS, CBD, etc. ‚Äî the equity status for all of these will be subject to the lender. To eliminate any confusion or frustration, borrowers should know that they may have to seek out supplemental equity sources depending on the lender used.</p>
