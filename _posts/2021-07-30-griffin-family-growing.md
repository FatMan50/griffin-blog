**JACKSONVILLE, FL**: A sister company to The Griffin Group International, LLC (“GGI”), Griffin Strategic Consulting (“GSC”) has been formed and is operational. <!--more-->GGI will carry on its 40-year heritage in the institutional debt and equity arenas for sponsors. To avoid any conflict of interest, both GGI and GSC are stand-alone entities and will remain so.

**GSC’s mission** is to assist CRE Sponsors PRIOR TO ENTERING THE DEBT AND EQUITY MARKETS by strategically positioning their CRE projects/holdings to gain attention from institutional sources.

There are many factors that allow GSC to piggy-back on GGI, and provide CRE strategies through GSC, without obligation or quid pro quo to GGI:

**1**) We are in the market daily through The Griffin Group International, LLC while we fill our client’s needs for institutional debt and equity. Griffin, doing one-off as well as bulk exclusive engagements, provides an alignment of interests for all stakeholders. That daily interaction can inure to the benefit of sponsors.

**2**) 40 years of experience and growing, with involvement in but not limited to demand generation and site selection, development, financing (non-recourse and recourse), construction, governmental approvals, grants, tax credits, TIFs, politics, etc.

**3**) GGI’s experience with numerous property types, including apartments, condos, retail, office, industrial, health care, senior housing, student housing, mobile home parks, self-storage, distribution, manufacturing, etc.

**4** GGI’s experience in debt and equity for ground-up, permanent, securitized financings, value-add, bridge, etc.

**5**) GGI’s keen sense of marketing, and its proprietary computerized funding parameters are in alignment with directing clients to the proper lane and source.

**6**) GSC’s guidance to sponsors building the entire capital stack including equity, mezzanine and senior financing in tranches geared to sponsors’ needs.

**7**) The principals’ personal experience with major CRE. At one time or another in the past, we have walked in your shoes. Unlike any other, we know what **NOT TO DO, as well as what TO DO**.

**Thus, we offer our consulting services through GSC to address the project market demand, least cost, best execution, as well as premier target marketing strategies for the sponsor.**
