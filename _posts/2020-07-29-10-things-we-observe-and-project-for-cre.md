## 1. Hotels
Although climbing in occupancy, hotels still have a long way to go before breaking even. We envision a good deal of CAPEX to address pandemic health of hotel guests.<!--more-->

## 2. Retail
Retail centers will continue to lose ground to online retailers, as the pandemic has many folks shopping online.

## 3. Student Housing
Once the darling of the industry, Student Housing will continue to slide. With distance learning becoming a more normal method of education, Colleges and Universities will start repurposing some of their brick and mortar.

## 4. Regional Malls
Having a hard time competing, malls will continue the trends of entertainment venues while some will also see a repurposing to medical.

## 5. Office
Once the commuters nightmare, office work will shrink substantially. Many businesses have already started the permanent transition, allowing employees a wide berth working from home.

## 6. Entertainment
Gyms, Bowling Alleys, Movie Theatres and the like will suffer long-term effects of social distancing. CAPEX expenses for keeping customers safe will be substantial.

## 7. Residential
Apartments, Condos and single-family homes will feature more work from home space.

## 8. Recreation
Campgrounds and RV Parks will become significantly more popular than ever, with folks appreciating the space around them.

## 9. Banks
Brick and mortar bank branches will continue being sold by banks and leased back, with excess space rented to outside tenants.

## 10. Mixed-Use
Projects may see a shift in mix as segments of the mixed-use property vacate, and a more residential component expands.
