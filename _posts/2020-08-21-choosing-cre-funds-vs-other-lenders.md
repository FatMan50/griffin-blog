With the experience of over forty years and several billion dollars in closings, Griffin’s team is in a unique position to advise clients effectively. Here are the Top 10 reasons why we advise borrowing from a Commercial Real Estate Fund over other lenders:<!--more-->

##### 1. Professionalism
Screening, underwriting, processing, and closing are executed at the highest level.

##### 2. Expert Targeting
Targeted property type and class are specific.

##### 3. Non-Recourse
The majority of all our deals are non-recourse with “bad boy” carveouts and completion guarantees.

##### 4. Expediency
Immediate funding is available, with delivery in as few as 60 days in most cases.

##### 5. Flexibility
Terms are negotiable and customizable to your project’s specific needs.

##### 6. Affordability
Any margin over regulated lender rates is justifiable due to the higher LTC, or LTV being less expensive than equity.

##### 7. Incentive Programs
Grants, tax credits, Pace, TIF and LP Pref investors understood.

##### 8. Accessibility
Nationwide lending in primary, secondary and tertiary markets.

##### 9. Opportunity
Ground up, value add, adaptive reuse, heavy lift, and bridge are all considered.

##### 10. Efficiency
Committee sign-off by only a few signatories makes for seamless transactions.
